# Machine Learning Project: Support Vector Machine (SVM) 🚀

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Machine Learning project utilizing the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. SVM is a highly effective and robust supervised learning model, primarily used for classification tasks. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between different classes.

## Project Details
The Jupyter Notebook (`SVM.ipynb`) details the complete pipeline for training and evaluating an SVM classifier. A significant focus of this project is placed on accuracy optimization. The workflow includes data preprocessing, defining the feature space, and tuning the model's parameters to ensure the highest possible classification accuracy and generalization on unseen data.

## Key Features
* **Hyperplane Optimization:** Implementing the core SVM logic to find the optimal decision boundary that separates data classes with the maximum margin.
* **Accuracy Enhancement:** Actively tuning hyperparameters and adjusting the model to increase overall classification accuracy.
* **Kernel Utilization:** Exploring linear and non-linear boundaries to handle complex datasets effectively.
* **Performance Evaluation:** Rigorously testing the model using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix.

## Technologies Used
* **Python 3**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **NumPy & Pandas** (Data manipulation and mathematical operations)
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (Visualizing data distribution and decision boundaries)
